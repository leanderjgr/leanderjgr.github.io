# Welcome to Leander Jay Pages
####  On this page, you will see a motivational speech from Coach Mav and the sport that I play.
You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/leanderjgr/leanderjgr.github.io/edit/main/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Jekyll Themes
